                  JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                  is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                  example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                  its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                  and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                  structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                  variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                  example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                    client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                    HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                    and page navigation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                    extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                    the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                  </li>
                </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code
                  >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                  greetMe("World");
                </code>
          
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!
              </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
              </p>
              <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            <header>Data Types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                      <li>
                        null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                        is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                        other variant.
                      </li>
                      <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                      <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                      <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                      <li>
                        Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                        unique and immutable.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
          
                  <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

        <section class="main-section" id="If_Else_Statement">
            <header>If Else Statement</header>
            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:
          
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                  You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                  conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code
                  >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                  } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
                </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:
          
                <code
                  >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                  statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                  statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                  statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
                >
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:
          
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="While_Statement">
            <header>While Statement</header>
            <article>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
          
                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.
          
                <p>
                  The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                  the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                  tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                  control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
          
                <p>
                  To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                  those statements.
                </p>
          
                Example:
          
                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>
          
                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                  With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                  Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>
          
                <ul>
                  <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                  <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                  <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                  true, so the loop terminates.
                </p>
